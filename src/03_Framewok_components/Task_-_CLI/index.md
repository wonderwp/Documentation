# The Task Component (to create WP-CLI commands)

WonderWp can help you create and organize your own WP-CLI commands.

To do so, create a Task Service, as described in the [dedicated documentation section](../../02_Creating_a_plugin/01_Understanding_the_WonderWp_philosophy/06_Services/05_Task_service.md).

# Getting started with WonderWp

## 1) Install WonderWp

The installation guide is documented in the [installation page](../01_Installation).

## 2) Generate your first plugin

Using the generator to build a first plugin is a good way to start learning how WonderWp encourages you to organize a plugin.

This could be a good introduction to WonderWp plugin principles without worrying of building and learning in parallel.

WonderWp can build the plugin structure for you to help you focus on learning the basics.

The generator documentation is available [on this page](../02_Creating_a_plugin/02_Generator.md)

## 3) Learn more about your plugin

Once you've got a generated base, head over to the [plugin architecture](../02_Creating_a_plugin/03_Plugin_architecture) documentation to discover how to work your way around it.

## 4) Learn more about the framework components and capabilities

Once you've gotten your head around the basics, it's time to learn some more advances topics to truly feel the framework potential.

Here's the link to the [framework components](../03_Framewok_components) documentation, where you'll find out more about dependency injection, routing, logging, and so on.

## 5) Keep on building

You're all set to express your full potential. We wish you the most pleasant development experience.

## 6) Contribute if you'd like

WonderWp is an open source framework, which means anyone can contribute.

If you've spotted a bug, would like to add some features, or add some tests for example, head up to the [contribution page](../04_Contribution/02_Contributing.md) to get contribution instructions.

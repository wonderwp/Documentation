# Introduction

WonderWp's purpose is to help you build plugins (and themes) professionally, with an opinionated organisation that helps you in different areas:

- Having a consistent plugin structure helps you to switch context more easily. As a matter of fact, once you get the understanding of WonderWp, you'll be able to navigate between projects without loosing time to investigate how each of them has been built or thought.
- It also helps with training. Once a teammate understands the plugin philosophy, he would be able to build on his own or contribute to existing plugins rapidly.
- You do not loose time with architecture and focus solely on your plugin added value.

In this chapter you'll learn how WonderWp's plugin philosophy can help you build clean and professional plugins through a series of key points : 

- [The File architecture](./02_File_architecture.md)
- [The bootstrap file](./03_Plugin_bootstrap_file.md)
- [The plugin manager](./04_Plugin_Manager.md)
- [Services](../04_Services)
- [Controllers & views](./05_Public_controller.md)
